          <h2>Hyper Incarceration</h2>
          <p>When the war on drugs targeted black people and defined them as criminals, a system of hyperincarceration stained the communities of minorities. Black men to this day are incarcerated at rates drastically higher than other racial groups. “1 in every 15 African American men and 1 in every 36 Hispanic men are incarcerated in comparison to 1 in every 106 white men,” (www.americanprogress.org). With so many black men in jail, there are many harmful impacts. Young black men with jailed fathers look for role models in their communities. Often the local gangs are the most attractive option for support. Between the ages 13-15 kids in Illinois are automatically tried as adults (this is called ‘automatic transfer’) for crimes including, murder, criminal sexual assault, armed robbery, vehicular hijacking, drug and weapon violations on or within 1,000 feet of a school or public housing. Gang activity includes many of these illegal pursuits, resulting in many long sentences for kids that haven’t reached high school. In society we often portray black children as dangerous adults, this stereotype is heightened by the automatic transfer of kids. Hyperincarceration is in turn a leading cause for rampant gang violence. There is a cycle of incarceration to violence and back to incarceration, a cycle that sets many black people at a disadvantage from birth. </p>

          <h2>Segregation</h2>
          <p>Although Chicago is one of the country's most diverse cities, it's also the one of the most segregated, behind Milwaukee and New York. Although the level of segregation has gone down over the years, it still remains very high, as anyone can see just by walking through a couple of Chicago's many neighborhoods, with examples being Lincoln Park and Pilsen. Today, the average white resident in Chicago lives in a 76% white neighborhood and the average black resident lives in a 64% black neighborhood. Often minorities are polarized to certain parts of the city, specifically the South and West side. In order for the city to reach complete integration, 76% of the black population would have to move. 
          Due to the amount of segregation, there is plenty of unfair school funding and the quality of the education is very different. Tuition at some of the most prestigious private school can cost up to $32,000 a year, and the average family cannot afford it. Since Illinois relies heavily on property taxes, the poorer a student's neighborhood is, the less opportunities they can receive. For example, the Chicago Ridge school is able to spend $9,794 per student while the Roundout school is only able to spend $28,639 per student. 
          Most of the reason why Chicago still remains as segregated as it is today is income. The white and highly educated are moving to the Northside, while low income neighborhoods in the South and West sides are growing. The poverty rate of blacks is 2x that of whites, and the blacks in Chicago have seen their income shrink. Some housing and mortgage policies also limit people's ability to buy and build wealth. Also, even if residents are moving out of the city, they still typically move to the suburbs with a strong concentration of their race. Some communities are also protesting integration, as a local cafe in Pilsen is facing anti-gentrification graffiti telling white people to "get out." Gentrification is a general term for the arrival of wealthier people in an existing urban district, a related increase in rents and property values, and changes in the district's character and culture. </p>

          <h2>War on Drugs</h2>
          <p>The War on Drugs, declared by Nixon in 1971, has detrimentally affected poor minority communities to this day. In 1994, John Ehrlichman, Nixon’s former domestic policy adviser, explains the reasoning the counterproductive war on drugs was declared, “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did,” (Erlichman, harpers.org). Even the people responsible for the war on drugs knew its real reasoning for creation. According to Michelle Alexander, the war on drugs created a new racial caste system beyond the agenda of  Nixon’s presidency. “The notion that a vast gulf exists between ‘criminals’ and those of us who have never served time in prison is a fiction created by the racial ideology that birthed mass incarceration, namely that there is something fundamentally wrong and morally inferior about ‘them.’ The reality, though, is that all of us have done wrong. As noted earlier, studies suggest that most Americans violate drug laws in their lifetime. Indeed, most of us break the law not once but repeatedly throughout our lives. Yet only some of us will be arrested, charged, convicted of a crime, branded a criminal or a felon, and ushered into a permanent undercaste.” The war on drugs is in fact ‘the new jim crow’ or a new way to define and degrade blackness. Slavery defined black people as slaves, Jim crow defined black people as second class citizens, mass incarceration defines black people still as second class citizens- or more commonly accepted as ‘criminals.’ The war on drugs -despite it’s obvious racist origins- is still pursued and apparent today in drug policies, law enforcement, and mass incarceration. Drug policies were adopted amongst every presidency post Nixon and leached into the ‘new’ democratic party during the Clinton administration who proved to be tougher on drug related crimes than any president prior. Though harsh drug policies are somewhat reformed today, there are still many people in jail for crimes considered obsolete.</p>

          <h2>School to Prison Pipeline</h2>
          <p>The School to Prison Pipeline has been incarcerating black, latino, and disabled teens in public schools for many years now. Caused by “zero tolerance policies,” the smallest infractions can lead to punishments such as suspension, expulsion, and even getting getting arrested, leading a student’s way to jail. These zero tolerance policies are leading to police involvement in situations that can normally be situated inside of the school, and more and more students are being criminalized. Suspensions are being given out for many minor misbehaviors, such as dress code violation, tardiness, and the use of bad language. It’s already know that students who have been suspended or expelled are more likely to end up in prison than students who have not, so why are these forms of discipline being put into effect so often? Many people believe it’s because of how big the prison industry is and how many jobs it creates. Schools are directly sending their kids to prison without an in between or attempt at improvement for their actions. The stereotype that black children can be dangerous adults only plays to how many children are being incarcerated, and less white students are being punished for the same infractions that black students are, by a significant amount. </p>
